I successfully defended my PhD as part of a cotutelle program between Université du Luxembourg & Arts et Métiers ParisTech - École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers (i-biomec I2M – Institut de Mécanique et d’Ingénierie de Bordeaux)

My thesis, entitled *“Biomechanical Response of Human Skin: a Hierarchical Porous Media Framework”*, explored and evaluated a novel two-compartment porous model to capture the interaction between the mechanical behavior of soft tissues and microcirculatory response.

This journey was made possible thanks to the support and mentorship of my supervisors:
Stéphane P.A. Bordas (FLSW), Pierre-Yves Rohan and Giuseppe Sciumè.

I’m also grateful to the jury and expert members for the rich and insightful discussions during the defence:
Yohan Payan, Stéphane Avril, Christian Vincenot, Dr.-Ing. Silvia Budday, and Sébastien LAPORTE.

A special thank you as well to our collaborating laboratories -Laboratoire de Biologie Tissulaire et Ingénierie thérapeutique (LBTI), Institut FEMTO-ST, Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay)- whose contributions, especially on the experimental side, were essential. 

Heartfelt thanks to the volunteers who participated in the experimental cohorts and to all the individuals who contributed to this PhD.

Finally, I am honoured to have been proposed for the Pierre Béziers prize (ENSAM), Excellent Thesis Award (University of Luxembourg), the FNR Outstanding PhD Thesis, and the pre-selection for Prix Tarrach of *Les Amis du Luxembourg*.

This work was supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) under grant n° 17013182.

On to the next chapter!
