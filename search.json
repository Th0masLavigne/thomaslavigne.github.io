The project is built on two inter-connected technical pillars. First, we developed and evaluated a Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) pipeline to accurately measure 3D kinematic fields within soft tissues under significant displacements. This innovative methodology, which utilizes X-ray tomography for detailed imaging, has critical clinical applications, such as enabling the precise mapping of ex vivo breast deformations to improve the accuracy of radiotherapy planning by assisting with tumor repositioning. Complementary to this, the project also designed a novel optimization framework that employs an inverse+forward hyper-elasticity formulation to simultaneously identify the unknown material parameters and the contact traction field of soft bodies from measured deformed geometries. By rigorously integrating computational modeling with experimental data, this work provides powerful tools for a complete and robust understanding of soft tissue mechanics in various physiological and loading scenarios.

My PhD work combines them in a unified porous model, developed and evaluated alongside new experiments on human patients. Think of the skin as a living sponge filled with tiny blood vessels. When pressure is applied, it’s gradually squeezed, cutting off oxygen — and when released, blood rushes back in. This new model reveals the subtle interplay between mechanical stress and biological response (ischemia and hyperemia), helping us understand when and how damage starts. This open-source work marks a significant step forward in understanding and preventing pressure ulcers — and moves us closer to truly personalized medicine.

It was designed to complement the resource “Introduction to Biomechanics,” which covers several important points of this discipline. The present resource is based on research work conducted during the authors’ master’s degree in biomechanics, as well as their master 1 internships, master 2 thesis, and pre-doctoral research year. click here\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction à la Biomécanique\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomechanics, in its commonly accepted definition, consists of applying the tools, methods, and principles of mechanics to biological tissues and organs and their associated medical problems. It is an ancient discipline, studied since antiquity, but it became established as a distinct field in its own right during the 1960s and 1970s. As a varied discipline at the intersection of multiple subjects and methods, it is difficult to approach this theme using a single method. Thus, this resource aims to present the main challenges, their associated analyses and measurement tools, and their clinical applications. It is therefore not an exhaustive list of the topics studied, but an approach to the scientific methodology centered around the biomechanical question. First, we will present what historically founded the domain, namely the analysis of locomotion and movement. Second, we will focus on the effects of forces and deformations on tissues and the biological processes involved. Finally, we will consider the, primarily clinical, applications of the developed tools, and their place and potential in the current treatment of pathologies. The resource “Mechanical characterization of a soft tissue: passive muscle” specifically addresses the process of modeling a complex tissue using the tools of continuum mechanics. click here"

    "text": "This research project, undertaken as an M1 Internship related to Antoine Knwebleski’s PhD, was dedicated to developing advanced biomechanical models to investigate head and neck dynamics during impact events, with a direct application to concussion prevention in sports such as rugby. The central technical task involved the creation and implementation of rheological muscle models for the cervical spine region within the MATLAB/Simulink simulation environment. These models were designed to accurately simulate the complex action of neck muscles during a sudden torso impact. The primary objective was to quantitatively assess the protective effect of muscle preactivation—the voluntary tensing of muscles prior to impact—on mitigating peak head and neck accelerations. By establishing a clearer understanding of this neuromuscular defense mechanism, the project delivers crucial simulated data essential for evaluating and optimizing existing concussion protocols, thereby advancing player safety in contact sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project provides a critical experimental analysis into the complex mechanical behavior of pantographic metamaterials, specifically seeking to understand how their architectured structure influences the Poynting effect—the coupling between torsion and axial deformation. Researchers employed a sophisticated multiscale Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) methodology to analyze an in situ torsion test on a 3D-printed Inconel pantograph, utilizing micro-computed tomography to acquire detailed 3D volumes of the sample across a large range of angular amplitudes (up to 180°). The innovative technique was adapted to overcome challenges such as low internal contrast and large rotations, allowing for the precise measurement of displacement and strain fields at both the macroscopic and mesoscopic scales. This work not only confirmed the existence of the Poynting effect at the macrolevel but, more critically, provided novel quantitative data on its emergence at the mesoscopic scale—revealing local contraction mechanisms in the hinges. The resulting kinematic data serves as an invaluable foundation for validating and calibrating advanced constitutive models for these high-performance architectured materials.

The trip served to strengthen research ties and provided invaluable insights into cutting-edge methodologies for both the physical study and the numerical simulation of complex brain mechanics.\nWe’re excited about the possibility of reconducting this initiative in the future!\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n❮ ❯\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The core work involves using experimental data to identify the material’s mechanical properties based on its fabrication conditions. A key objective is the enhancement of these models to incorporate the complex influence of contractile cells within the gel, specifically including their mechanoperception response. Further development will integrate microstructural information to accurately describe how the collagen fibers move and reorient under mechanical load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/2025-11/2025 - Post Doctoral Researcher ANR MATISSE: Simulation of porous liquids and HPC installations\n\n\nAt: Institut de mécanique et d’ingénierie, Université de Bordeaux INP, UMR 5295, CNRS\nWith: Giuseppe Sciumè\nProject: I primarily focused on simulating the mechanical behavior of porous fluids (e.g., poroelastic models for fluids) using the advanced finite element software FEniCSx. In addition to leading these simulations, the Postdoc will provide essential computational and numerical support to four specific PhD students (S. Pastore, C. Cornillon, M. Laccour, and L. Liquette) to help them overcome technical hurdles in their research. A key institutional responsibility involves installing and configuring the FEniCSx environment on the available MCIA HPC (High-Performance Computing) cluster and creating a comprehensive installation and usage procedure document for the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022-2025 - Co-tutelle PhD (ENSAM, Université du Luxembourg)\n\nAFR Fond National de la Recherche du Luxembourg Grant.\n\n\nTitle: Biomechanical Response of Human Skin: A Hierarchical Porous Media Framework.
